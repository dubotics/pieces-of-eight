Pieces of Eight
===============

Pieces of Eight was one of two remotely-operated robots made for the UW robotics
club's 2011 entry in the now-defunct collegiate-level FIRST robotics
competition.  The 'bot is an octagonal omni-wheel-driven tennis-ball shooter
designed to deliver balls to designated bins on an arena.

Both robot- and client-side code are included in this repository.

  - `robot` contains the robot-side code, as an Arduino sketch.

  - `java-client`, as included in a 29 Nov. 2013 commit, contains the unreviewed
    client-side code (in `java-client/src`) and miscellaneous libraries (for
    Windows and JVM platforms) that it requires.
